# Recirculatory-Fluidised-Bed-Reactor-Design

A fluidised bed offers excellent heat transfer and has an ability to fluidise solid particles in fluid like fashion. A fluidised catalytic cracking (FCC) unit is used to convert heavy hydrocarbons to petroleum crude oils. 

This project is about designing the reactor geometry for a recirculating fluidised bed geometry.
